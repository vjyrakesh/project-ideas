# project-ideas
Project ideas to learn a new technology.

Any new technology is best learnt by doing some real projects, and this repo provides ideas to work on as projects. All the ideas captured in this repo are meant to be technology/platform agnostic, thereby lending themselves to be implemented in any technology. 

However, there're some some good software engineering practices that need to be followed while working on any project. Some of them are:
- version controlled code
- containers as distribution mechanism
- good README.md
- tests (as much as possible)
